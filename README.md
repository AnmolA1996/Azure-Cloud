✦                                                                                                                                                                                      ![image](https://github.com/AnmolA1996/Azure-Cloud/assets/105154769/5f60549b-c6a0-4bc1-978c-ea66dddc5a26)
                                                          
Azure cloud provides agility, consumption-based pricing, high availability, faster recovery, and scalability.

Agility: 

Real-life example: Imagine a buffet at a restaurant where you can choose to fill your plate with different dishes based on what you feel like eating. You have the flexibility to pick and choose based on your specific tastes at that moment. In the context of cloud services, agility means being able to quickly and easily choose and adapt the right service to meet your specific needs or goals.

Consumption-based pricing: 

Real-life example: Electricity usage at home is a great example of this. You are billed based on the amount of electricity you use. In cloud services, it's like paying for only the resources and features you actually use, similar to how you pay for the exact amount of electricity you consume each month.

High availability: 

Real-life example: Think of a reliable food delivery service that is available 24/7, no matter the weather or time of day. You can count on it to deliver food to your doorstep whenever you need it. In cloud services, high availability means that the infrastructure and services are designed to be resilient and reliable, ensuring they are almost always accessible and operational.

Faster recovery: 

Real-life example: Cloud storage services that automatically save and back up your important documents or photos can act as an analogy. If you accidentally delete a file, you can quickly recover it from the backup without any hassle. In cloud services, faster recovery means having mechanisms in place to swiftly recover data or services after any disruptions or issues.

Scalability: 

Real-life example: A customizable modular shelf that allows you to add or remove shelves based on your storage needs can represent scalability. You can adjust it to accommodate more or fewer items as required. In cloud services, scalability means the ability to easily adjust resources to meet changing demands without worrying about resource limitations.

These real-life examples should help you understand how these cloud features work in a more relatable way.


02:36


Agility in terms of using the right service that meets specific goals and adapting to changing needs.
Consumption-based pricing allows paying only for what is used, accommodating fluctuations in usage and seasonality.
High availability ensures resilient infrastructure and mechanisms for architecting services.
Faster recovery with distributed deployments over large distances to mitigate the impact of natural disasters.

Scalability eliminates concerns about resource limitations.
✦
Azure provides different types of cloud services, including private and hybrid cloud.

08:09 and 10:46

Private cloud refers to running on-premises infrastructure with quotas and policies for control.
Hybrid cloud involves using both private and public cloud, allowing for variable workloads and burst usage.

Azure is an example of a public cloud service with options for operational expenditure (OpEx) payment model.

Public clouds are suitable for variable workload scenarios where you pay for what you use.

The public cloud is ideal for scenarios where workloads have variable loads, such as on and off usage or rapid growth for startups.

Shared responsibilities exist between the customer and the provider in the public cloud, with different responsibilities depending on the service used.

Public Cloud:

- Real-life example: Imagine using a public transportation system, like buses or trains. You only pay for the rides you take, and the transportation system is responsible for maintaining and operating the vehicles and infrastructure. Similarly, in a public cloud, you pay for the resources you use, like virtual machines and storage, and the cloud service provider takes care of the underlying infrastructure and maintenance.

Private Cloud:

- Real-life example: Think of a privately owned and managed swimming pool in a residential property. The owners have full control over its use, who can access it, and the rules for its maintenance and operation. Similarly, in a private cloud, an organization runs its own cloud infrastructure with complete control over the resources, policies, and security.

Hybrid Cloud:

- Real-life example: Consider a hybrid car that can use both traditional fuel and electric power. Depending on the driving conditions, the car automatically switches between the two power sources to optimize performance and efficiency. Similarly, in a hybrid cloud scenario, organizations can use a combination of on-premises resources (private cloud) and public cloud resources to manage variable workloads, optimize costs, and ensure flexibility.

PaaS focuses on providing blocks for app development while SaaS provides business functions

PaaS allows developers to focus on their app and data, while SaaS provides ready-to-use business functions like SharePoint and email.
PaaS does not provide a business function on its own, unlike SaaS.

![image](https://github.com/AnmolA1996/Azure-Cloud/assets/105154769/9d901976-156c-43b2-81d1-531c789c61ec)

Platform as a Service (PaaS):

Real-life example: 

Think of a construction company that provides pre-built building blocks and tools to architects and builders. These building blocks allow the architects and builders to focus on the design and construction of the building, without having to worry about the infrastructure, like concrete and steel. Similarly, PaaS provides developers with pre-built software components, application development tools, and infrastructure, allowing them to focus on creating and deploying their applications without managing the underlying hardware or software layers.
Software as a Service (SaaS):

Real-life example: 

Consider using a cloud-based email service like Gmail or Microsoft Office 365. You can access and use email and productivity applications directly without having to worry about installing, maintaining, or managing the underlying hardware or software. Similarly, SaaS provides ready-to-use business functions like email, document collaboration, customer management, or file storage, allowing users to access and use these applications directly without having to manage the infrastructure or backend services.
In summary, PaaS empowers developers to focus on building their applications by providing them with development tools and infrastructure, while SaaS offers ready-to-use business functions that users can directly access and utilize, without needing to manage the underlying technology stack.

Azure has multiple regions to meet data sovereignty requirements, ensure disaster recovery, and minimize latency.

Azure regions are set up to comply with data sovereignty regulations, allowing users to host their data in specific countries.
Having multiple regions enables disaster recovery by ensuring that services are not impacted by natural disasters.
Azure regions are strategically placed to minimize latency and provide a better user experience by placing services closer to customers.

Azure Regions for Data Sovereignty:

- Real-life example:
  
- Consider a secure document storage facility in a specific country that allows individuals or organizations to store sensitive documents locally to comply with data protection laws. Similarly, Azure regions are set up to comply with data sovereignty regulations, enabling users to host their data in specific countries, ensuring compliance with local data protection and privacy laws.

Azure Regions for Disaster Recovery:

- Real-life example:

  Think of a company that has backup data centers in different geographical locations to ensure business continuity in case of a natural disaster or unexpected outage. Azure regions enable disaster recovery by providing redundant infrastructure in different geographic areas, ensuring that services remain operational even if a particular region is affected by a natural disaster or outage.

Azure Regions for Latency Optimization:

- Real-life example:

Imagine a fast-food chain strategically placing their restaurants in different neighborhoods to ensure that customers can access their services with minimal travel time. Similarly, Azure regions are strategically placed to minimize latency and provide a better user experience by locating services closer to customers, reducing the time it takes for data to travel between the user and the service.

In summary, Azure regions are designed to meet data sovereignty requirements, enable disaster recovery, and minimize latency, much like how secure document storage facilities comply with data protection laws, companies establish backup data centers, and businesses strategically position their service outlets for optimal customer experience.  

![image](https://github.com/AnmolA1996/Azure-Cloud/assets/105154769/bb37901f-9ddb-4963-888e-e708447a3dd1)

23:24 & 26:00

Azure uses pairings of regions for resiliency and updates

Pairings exist within the same geopolitical boundary, except for Brazil
Pairings are used by certain services in Azure for resiliency
Updates are staggered to paired regions to avoid downtime
Regions have multiple physical buildings that act as availability zones

✦
Resiliency is achieved by distributing services over multiple buildings using availability zones.

The concept of a subscription is used to expose availability zones in each region.
Availability zones can differ between different subscriptions, but within a single subscription, the same availability zones will always map to the same buildings.
Some services are inherently zone redundant, while others need to be pinned to a specific availability zone and multiple instances need to be created to achieve resiliency.
To ensure resiliency across availability zones, zonal VMs need to be created.

 Certainly! Let's break down the information with real-world analogies for clarity:

Pairings for Resiliency and Updates:
Real-life example: Think of a backup generator for a building. If the main power source fails, the backup generator ensures that the building continues to have uninterrupted power. Similarly, Azure uses pairings of regions for resiliency. Just as the backup generator ensures continuous power, if one region experiences issues, the paired region can seamlessly take over to avoid downtime. 

Availability Zones and Subscriptions:
Real-life example: Consider a hotel with multiple wings, each equipped with its own independent power and water supply. Each wing represents an availability zone, and the entire hotel is like an Azure region. The concept of a subscription in Azure is similar to guests booking rooms in this hotel. Guests (or subscribers) are assigned rooms in specific wings (availability zones) with consistent amenities.

Zone Redundancy and Zonal VMs:
Real-life example: Picture a network of bank branches, each with its own secure vault to store cash. If one branch experiences a security issue, the cash in the other branches remains secure. This represents services that are inherently zone redundant. Zonal VMs, on the other hand, are like having multiple bank branches in a city to ensure that a service (or bank branch) remains available even if a specific location faces difficulties.

By using these real-world examples, we can understand how Azure's regions, pairings, availability zones, and resiliency features work in a more tangible way.  

✦
Azure AD (AAD) is a cloud-based identity provider used by Azure and other services.

31:08
